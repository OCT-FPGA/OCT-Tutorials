# Existing Users

## Users who haven't created a VM

If you haven't created a VM, follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/OCT-FPGA/OCT-Tutorials/blob/master/mocsetup/instancesetup.md).

## Users who have created a VM

If you have created a VM, you can use any SSH client to connect to the VM. If you need a graphical user interface, you need to set up VNC access. Setting up SSH and VNC access for the VM has been covered in [this tutorial](https://github.com/OCT-FPGA/OCT-Tutorials/tree/master/vncsshsetup).
